## Setup
1. Install the Python dependencies
    ```

    ```

2. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/) and create an application and a bot.

3. Copy your bot's token into a `.env` file in the root directory. ex:
    ```
    DISCORD_TOKEN="YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN_HERE"
    ```

4. Add your bot to the countdown channel and copy the ID of the channel into a `channels.txt` file in the root directory. ex:

    ```

5. Run the bot

    ```



## Behavior
- When a user posts out of turn the bot reacts to the message with ‚õî.
- When a user posts an incorrect number the bot reacts to the message with ‚ùå.
- When a user posts a number divisible by 200 the bot pins it.
